Motivational behavior

‚ÄúWhen nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it, but all that had gone before.‚Äù
- Jacob August Riis (1.849 - 1.914)

‚ÄúQuando nada parece dar certo, vou ver o cortador de pedras martelando sua rocha, cem vezes, sem que uma √∫nica rachadura apare√ßa. Mas na cent√©sima primeira martelada, a pedra se abre em duas, e eu sei que n√£o foi aquela que conseguiu isso, mas todas as que vieram antes‚Äù
